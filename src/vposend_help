Usage: vposend [-D] -a application -s severity -m "message"
           [ -k message key ] [ -A action,detail ] [ -t msg-type ]
    where:
         -a This is the name of the Application. This value maps
            to the VPO message group, to the Peregrine queue and
            AlarmPoint Group
         -s Severity. This must be: critical|major|minor|warning|normal
            Critical and Major events are passed to Peregrine and
            subsequently to AlarmPoint
            Minor and Warning are just passed to Peregrine
            Normal does not get passed.
            Peregrine Severity matching:
               Critical = Peregrine Sev 2
               Major    = Peregrine Sev 3
               Minor    = Peregrine Sev 4
               Warning  = Peregrine Sev 5
         -m Message text. Note: protect white space in the text,
            action, detail,  fields by using double quotes 
            ( i.e. -t "this is a test message" )
         -k Key to use for duplicate message type suppression
            If a key is defined, all other messages that are
            generated with the same key (but possibly different
            message text) are suppressed from processing in VPO
         -A Action to run and the detail parameters required for
            running the pre-defined action.
               "email, recipient; recipient, email subject line"
               "emailfyi, recipient; recipient, email subject line"
               "comfort, ap group(s) or ap person_id(s), method (pager, sms, or email)"

               NOTE: If multiple actions are desired then 
                     multiple -A parameters must be used.  Do
                     not add any other arguments between the 
                     multiple -A parameters
                    valid -A "email,recipient" -a "emailfyi,recipient"
                          -A Help
                  invalid -A "email,recipient" -t type -A "emailfyi,recipient"
         -t Type. Used for Testing and QA. Any messages generated
            with the Type QA or TEST will be proceesed by VPO
            but no escalation to Perrgrine or AlarmPoint will be done
         -D Debug mode. For testing and developer use

Alternate Usage for ssm logfile processing: 
    vposend [-D] -f "contents of ssm log file record to be parsed"
         -f File mode. For sending a SSM file record. In
            conjunction with -D can be used for testing
            syntax and function of log file records.
               - The contents of the file must meet the SSM
                 log file requirements
         -D Debug mode. For testing and developer use
